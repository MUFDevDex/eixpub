# Einix Static Site

This repository contains a simple one-page business site for **Einix** generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The final HTML is located in `einixsite/public` and can be published with GitHub Pages by selecting that folder as the source.

Run `hugo` inside `einixsite` to rebuild the site after making changes.
