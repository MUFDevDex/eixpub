# Einix Static Site

This repository contains a simple one-page business site for **Einix** generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The final HTML is located in `einixsite/public` and can be published with GitHub Pages by selecting that folder as the source.

## Building

1. Install the extended version of `hugo`.
2. Run `hugo -D` inside `einixsite` to regenerate the `public` folder.

The contents of `einixsite/public` can then be served via GitHub Pages by
selecting that folder as the publishing source.
